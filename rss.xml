            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why We Need to Practice a Little Self-Compassion - Mindful</h1><p>In the frantic pace of life, it can be difficult to keep up-and sometimes when we make mistakes or we feel we don't work hard enough, we leave ourselves in the dust by thinking things like "you're not good enough." If we're not careful, a few harsh words here and there can evolve into excessive self-criticism.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0f6b606d36aeb415de50205a194226cf07ce06fe.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How mindfulness can help you to accept, and ultimately overcome, addiction - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk</h1><p>Addictions are funny things. Before I can help someone regain control over their life, we usually have to deal with shame. It's a terrible emotion. It arises naturally from the unconscious to let a person know that they've violated their own standards for how they want to live.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e4d9190cbe4e1a739238b4844f4926b5631bf7f1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
