            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Silence is golden: the art of meditation and inner stillness | The National</h1><p>How many times have you been told: "Don't just sit there, do something." In today's frenetic, smartphone wielding society, we have become hard-wired to multiÂ­task, often harbouring the belief that sitting still with one pointed focus is counterproductive. It's easy to see why many of us are more stressed out and "mind full" than ever before.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4c05dbe0f403d30f1e3b29e29f2c2d64ea0b894a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

This is how Dr. John Boockvar and his operating team prepare for surgery. Everyone on the neurosurgery team at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital stops what they are doing to breath.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a9b413136464e352488d4cbd90921759acc8ea1e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This Is Why Meditation Makes You Feel Better</h1><p>Usually, "do nothing" is poor advice to follow if you want to feel better. Yet a strong body of literature now shows that meditation-the mindful art of doing nothing but sitting still-effectively relieves pain. Now, a new study published in the Journal of Neuroscience shows that meditation accomplishes this differently from other pain-relievers, like opiates.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/346781782f324677d9e5a0d599932fb9fd00b1db.jpg"></article>]]></description>
