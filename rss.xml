            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Mindfulness Can Help Kids In The Classroom</h1><p>Posted: Picture a room full of energetic four-to-five year-olds just back from recess. Now picture trying to get that same bunch of kids to settle down and quietly meditate for a couple of minutes. Sounds impossible, right? Except this is exactly what early learning teacher Radha Babicci does with her class of preschoolers every day.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8376d68787154ead27820285b7b2fb5de97bd906.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Gentle parenting: The mindfulness alternative to 'time-out' - Independent.ie</h1><p>Before I had children, I knew of just one type of parenting - simply called 'parenting'. It was only after having kids that I realised just how many different parenting styles there are. There's authoritarian, where parents dictate and children obey; there's permissive, where children are allowed free rein; and everything else in between.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cd02063de19ab5b06b0258f94156c300c6f82b31.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Mindfulness-based eating awareness helps adolescents eat healthier foods, be more active</h1><p>Some of the simplest, safest lessons to help adolescents combat obesity may be raising their awareness of what they are eating and whether they are even hungry, researchers say. A pilot study of 40 adolescents in Richmond County, Georgia, showed that mindfulness-based eating awareness training encouraged adolescents to eat healthier and exercise more and marginalized their tendency to gain weight.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fea4e18cb009a6542ddc41d6a3f5adb6f80223b0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Although the weather outside is topsy-turvy, clients tend to come to see me about now in order to start losing enough weight to look good in a swimsuit for summer.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 Steps to Worrying Less - Mindful</h1><p>We've all heard the saying that in life there are ups and down and there is the classic eastern saying that life is filled with 10,000 joys and 10,000 sorrows. With this there's the wisdom that all things come and go, but the brain has a funny way of amplifying the sorrows and minimizing the joys for good evolutionary reasons.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c6590ef4269e629aee60046bc2caa91d918aaff5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>If you struggle to meditate, try this</h1><p>It's still beautiful, though, and as a stereotypically harried New Yorker, I was determined to spend some time gazing out meaningfully at the ocean, going on hikes, and so forth. One day early on, I ignored the rain and went to the Atlantic White Cedar Swamp trail (PDF), which features a boardwalk winding through a swamp.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7df368ea264a6aa7ecb30e86e7083e5561bd3896.jpg"></article>]]></description>
