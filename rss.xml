            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Silence is golden: the art of meditation and inner stillness | The National</h1><p>How many times have you been told: "Don't just sit there, do something." In today's frenetic, smartphone wielding society, we have become hard-wired to multiÂ­task, often harbouring the belief that sitting still with one pointed focus is counterproductive. It's easy to see why many of us are more stressed out and "mind full" than ever before.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4c05dbe0f403d30f1e3b29e29f2c2d64ea0b894a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Practicing 'mindfulness' pays off for NY surgeons</h1><p>The operating room can be a stressful place for surgeons and staff, so doctors at one New York hospital have found a simple way to relieve the pressure. This is how Dr. John Boockvar and his operating team prepare for surgery. Everyone on the neurosurgery team at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital stops what they are doing to breath.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a9b413136464e352488d4cbd90921759acc8ea1e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This Is Why Meditation Makes You Feel Better</h1><p>Usually, "do nothing" is poor advice to follow if you want to feel better. Yet a strong body of literature now shows that meditation-the mindful art of doing nothing but sitting still-effectively relieves pain. Now, a new study published in the Journal of Neuroscience shows that meditation accomplishes this differently from other pain-relievers, like opiates.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/346781782f324677d9e5a0d599932fb9fd00b1db.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Everything you need to know about mindfulness</h1><p>Every day we have between 60,000 and 80,000 thoughts. The vast majority of them are mundane and don't affect our mood, but there are an increasing number which cause us anxiety, panic and stress.
