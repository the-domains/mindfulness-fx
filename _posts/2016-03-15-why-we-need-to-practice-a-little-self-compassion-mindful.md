description: "In the frantic pace of life, it can be difficult to keep up-and sometimes when we make mistakes or we feel we don't work hard enough, we leave ourselves in the dust by thinking things like \"you're not good enough.\" If we're not careful, a few harsh words here and there can evolve into excessive self-criticism."
