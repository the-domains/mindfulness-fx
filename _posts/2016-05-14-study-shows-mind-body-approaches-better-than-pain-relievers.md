description: "Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be effective in treating chronic back pain, but it requires regular visits with a psychotherapist and can be expensive. A team from the University of Washington designed a study to determine whether mindfulness stress reduction-a technique that can be learned and practiced on one's own-is as effective in relieving pain and restoring function as cognitive behavioral therapy or conventional treatment with drugs and physical therapy."
