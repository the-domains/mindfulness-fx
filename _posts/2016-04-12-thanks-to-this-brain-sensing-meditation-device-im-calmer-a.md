description: "I've written before about my struggles to get a good night's sleep. Like most people, I have times where I can't fall or stay asleep. I've tried lots of things: Giving up caffeine (that was hard!), giving up alcohol (even harder), and getting up at 5:30 a.m. to work out (brutally, insanely hard)."
