  Recently the Pittsburgh Penguins celebrated their fourth Stanley Cup win,
  culminating with my favourite ice-hockey player, Sidney Crosby, being named
  the most valuable player. But that's not all. What was amazing about this win
  was the fact that the Penguins did it with a rookie goalie, Matt Murray,
  playing beyond his years.
