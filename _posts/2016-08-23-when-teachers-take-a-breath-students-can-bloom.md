  Garrison Institute looks a little like Hogwarts. The retreat center is housed
  in a former monastery amid tranquil green hills overlooking the Hudson River,
  60 miles north and a world away from New York City. Inside the airy chapel on
  a recent summer afternoon, a group of about 35 educators from the US and at
  least five foreign countries are seated quietly, shoes off.
