description: "A meditation session is a rendezvous between you and yourself. It's all about training and soothing the mind, and entering a mode of freedom and self-awareness which induces relaxation, joy, patience, emotional balance, and love. Meditation can be a path to achieving a spiritual end, but it is not necessarily linked with religions and sacred activities."
